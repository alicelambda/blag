There are three major models for kernel structures monolithic kernels, micro-kernels and exokernels. Each type of kernel has their own advantages and disvantages. Each kernel model.I've created this quiz for entertainment purposes.

- One api
- Multiplexing resources
- Unpredictable performance

Micro kernel
- Limited API
- Many tasks are run out in user space
- More complex to write

Exokernel
- No difference between user and kernel space
- Multiplexes hardware once
- System level things like managing memory are used for libraries
- Allows application specific policies for memory
