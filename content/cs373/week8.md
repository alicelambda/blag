# 1. What did you do this past week?

This week was the first week of full online class. It was very weird. I have not been able to focus on lectures. In conversations with my friends it seems that no one has been able to focus when listening to Zoom lectures.

# 2. What's in your way?

I have to catch up on a bunch of lectures. I also have to catch up on our Software engineering project. Our group didn't finish implementing unit tests for our frontend. I found the documentation for Mocha to be obtuse. Maybe it's because I haven't written react tests before but I have been running into a lot of import issues where I install library but then mocha doesn't find I tell it to load the module with `-r` option. I've also been struggling to do the in class quizzes because proctorIO takes a significant amount of time to "test network connections" so I don't have enough time to think about the problems. 

# 3. What will you do next week?

Try to catch up on school work. I'm looking forward to baking cookies.

# 4. What was your experience of Test 1b?

At first I was worried about having connection issues with ProctorIO but it seemed to just work. The test seemed pretty similar to part A. I enjoyed using Zoom to collaborate on the test because that's not something I've experienced in other classes. 

# 5. What made you happy this week?

Being able to walk my family dog. 

# 6. What's your pick of the week?

I've been using [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) recently as my goto editor. I like how it makes it easy to navigate between files in the explorer which you can hide with `Ctrl-Shift-E`.  I also like how the embedded terminal just works which you can open with   `Ctrl-Shift-Backtick`. In other editors like Emacs the terminal has been **Mostly** functional but I've run into weird edge cases when using tools like SSH. In Vscode it seems to just work. You can also split the terminal to which is nice if your looking at logs. I'm a fan of the [fairyfloss theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nopjmp.fairyfloss) which is a nice lavender theme made by SailorHG.
