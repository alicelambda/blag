description: "A weekly update for my software engineering class where I discuss: Nameservers, becoming an Information & Systems Security Society officer and our group presentations for our software engineering class"

# 1. What did you do this past week?

This past week, I studied for my upcoming global health exam. During meetings with my multicore team we wrote out a plan for how we were planning on implementing a nameserver. A nameserver in distributed/multicore computing is a service that allows processes to locate resources. For example, our memory server registers itself with our name server. When processes allocate memory they ask the name server for the location of the memory server and then the memory server performs the allocation and returns the address back to the processes. 

# 2. What's in your way?

I have many exams next week. My global health exam is happening next week as well as the two software engineering exams. Additionally, I have a take home linear algebra exam and the final milestone for multi-core to implement. 

# 3. What will you do next week?

Next week, I will mostly work on my upcoming assignments. I also register on Tuesday for fall classes.  Registering for Computer Science electives is always a struggle because they get filled up so quicky but I'm hopeful that I will get most of the electives I want. I'm hoping to take Algorithms and Complexity and Virtualization.

# 4. What was your expercience of the presentations?

It was nice to see the work of other teams. I was especially interested in the teams who made use of natural language processing apis to do sentiment analysis. The way [Stock Me Out](https://stockmeout.com/) did sentiment analysis on articles about stocks to see if there was a correlation between sentiment and stock price made me wonder what other possible signals could influence stock prices.

# 5. What made you happy this week?

I was excited to be accepted as an engineering officer at the Information & Systems Security Society at UT. It's a great group of people and I'm excited to teach people about security. It was also nice to touch base with some friends I'm in a book club with.

# 6. What's your pick of the week?

My pick of the week is [strace](https://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/22/fun-with-strace/). Strace is a useful command line utility to see what system calls an application is making. It's particurlary useful to see what a malfunctioning application may be doing. I've used it to debug why bspwm wasn't working on my arch linux desktop. Turns out I was missing a config file.
