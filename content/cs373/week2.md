# 1. What did you this past week?

This past week, I worked on my linear algebra homework. I also saw the prescreening of the DC Comics Birds of Prey movie which I enjoyed. This weekend I've mostly been working on our capabilities implementation for my multicore class. Capabilities are a way of doing access control and permission to access contiguous memory regions and other resources are granted at the process level.  Which allows for finer-grained permission schemes.

# 2. What's in your way?

Time, I wanted to start working on Collatz project earlier but linear algebra and multicore have been taking up a lot of my time. I managed to write the simplest possible solution but have not started the optimization part, which I know is going to take the bulk of the time.

# 3. What will you do next week?

Next week, I will finish the Collatz project. I also have a multicore project due Thursday as well as a linear exam so I'm going to be pretty busy. 

# 4. What was your experience of exceptions, types and operators? 

I knew a little about types and exceptions from learning Java in data structures. I found it interesting to know that you can have different classes of exceptions and that you can also have subclasses of exceptions. It was cool to see how python structures its types. I hadn't realized that only immutable types could be stored in a dict. This makes sense because you wouldn't want the hash of an object to change while it was stored in the set. 

# 5. What made you happy this week?

Watching Birds of Prey with my friends was fun. I've also been enjoying working out as a way to de-stress.


# 6. What's your tip of the week?

My tip of the week is [cscope](http://cscope.sourceforge.net/). Cscope is a program that allows you to explore a large C codebase rapidly. It lets you look up function names and declarations. It can also find all the functions that call a particular function. It is useful for finding the type declarations and files you need rapidly without having to remember all the file paths.
