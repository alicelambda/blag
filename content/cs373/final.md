# 1. What did you like least about the class?

I didn't like how the lecture content wasn't related to the project work. It was also challenging to balance team workload because the majority of the features had to be implemented on the website and there were very few people who knew react on our team.

# 2. What did you like the most about the class?

I liked how it challenged us to do a lot of independent learning. I feel much more confident in my ability to pick up other technical skills.

# 3. What's the most significant thing you learned?

The most significant thing I learned in this class is how the React state model works.  I spent a lot of time at the beginning of the class trying to figure out where and how to store data. Understanding the React state model and when components get rerendered was useful for understanding UI update bugs.

# 4. How many hours a week did you spend coding/debugging/testing for this class?

I spent roughly 15 hours a week coding for this class.

# 5. How many hours a week did you spend reading/studying for this class?

I spent roughly 4 hours a week reading and studying. I roughly wrote 1800 lines of React. 

# 6. What tool did you not know and know find very useful

I found the react developer tools to be very useful for debugging components.

# 7. What's the most useful web dev tool that your group used that was not required? 

We made extensive use of [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/). Material UI allowed us to create a nice user interface without having to do doing a lot of styling ourselves.

# 8. How did you feel about your group having to self teach many technologies?

I found it challenging to self teach all these technologies but I much more confident in my abilities.

# 9. How did you feel about the two-stage quizzes and tests?

The two-stage quizzes were too short and frequent to allow for peer learning. I enjoyed the two-part tests because it allowed me to see how my peers approached questions.

# 10. How did you feel about cold calling?

Cold calling was effective in helping me solidify my understanding of course concepts.
