# 1. Are you and your family safe and sound where you are?

Me as well as a few members of my family have been feeling sick lately. Also my mom is immunocompromised so I'm worried for her.

# 2. How do you feel about your ability to finish the term completely online?

I'm worried, I had trouble focusing when I took online classes last semester. My work environment at home also isn't ideal so it's going to be extra difficult to focus. I'm also worried about the loss of community and how it will be much harder to do collaborative work. 

# 3. What made you happy this week?

Being able to see my brother as well as our family dog. 

# 4. What's your pick of the week?

My pick of the week is [MyNoise](https://mynoise.net). It's a site that you can use to generate background noise such as a [coffee shop](https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/cafeRestaurantNoiseGenerator.php). It's really useful to be able tune out background noise since a lot of us will be working from home. I particularly like having the [flying fortress generator](https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/propellerNoiseGenerator.php) on while I code.
