# 1. What did you do this past week?

Last week, I turned in the Collatz assignment, I finished my multicore project and I took a linear algebra exam. It was pretty busy academically so I didn't have a lot of free time. I've started getting into meal prepping which has been fun.

# 2. What's in your way?
Not much, I just have to start working on things. 

# 3. What will you do next week?
Next week, I want to get a head start on the upcoming software engineer and multicore os projects.

# 4. What was your experience of Project #1: Collatz?
It was surprisingly satisfying when I got my collatz implementation to be fast enough to pass the final test case. Overall I found the actual writing of Collatz to be straight forward. It helped that I already had some python expercience. The optimization was the tricky part. I spent a while writing a script to find the optimal eager cache size, but at the end I ended up going with a lazy cache because I couldn't get the eager cache to be fast enough. 
# 5. What made you happy this week?
My cybersecurity team competed at (SWCCDC) the South West Collegiate Cyber Defence Competition. It's a competition where you have to defend a network against people who are trying to break into it. Oftentimes, the servers are in a pretty broken (misconfigured) state so part of the challenge is getting everything to be functional again. I also went to a friend's pal-entines dinner and it was nice to reconnect with people I hadn't seen in a while.
# 6. What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick of the week is [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). Emacs has been my go to editor for programming. It's easily customizable and there are many themes to choose from. My [emacs config](https://github.com/alicelambda/dotfiles/blob/master/.emacs) has allowed me to be very productive. Emac's killer feature is [orgmode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4). Orgmode is a structured text file, like markdown, that streamlines the process of taking notes. [Magit](https://magit.vc/) is an Emacs extension that provides a nice interface to git. [Ibuffer](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IbufferMode) lets you switch between files with just a couple of key strokes.
