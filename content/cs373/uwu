# 1. What did you do last week?
I finished milestone 0 for my multicore operating systems class. I also started to look at the collatz project for this course. 

# 2. What's in your way?
I'm trying to understand better the requirements for this class. Getting started with collatz feels slightly overwhelming just because I feel like there's a lot of steps you need to do before you start developing.

# 3. What will you do next week?

I want to finish collatz fairly early on in the week so I have time for my other classes and deadlines. I also have linear algebra hw due on Thursday so i'm trying to get that done earlier.

# 4. What is your experience with assertions, unit tests, coverage, and continuous integration?
I used assertations during my principals of operating systems course sophomore year. We primarily used them to make sure our kernel was in a non-broken state.

I don't have a lot of experience with unit testing. I have never used a tool that determines code coverage.

The dev team I worked with last summer practiced agile as well as continuous integration. The only times we ran into trouble as was when someone would break the master build or if we went too long without merging.

# 5. What made you happy this week?
I left a student org that I didn't feel super seen in. And it has felt good to have more free time.

# 6. What's your tip-of-the-week?
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is a static site generator written in Go. It's really easy to set up and extend. There are also a [ton](https://themes.gohugo.io) of themes that you can use and modify. I use hugo to build my blog. I built a docker container that has hugo installed so that I can automatically build my blog using Gitlab's CI/CD. Once the blog has been built it is then uploaded to Amazon S3 which is where I host my blog.
